# Bayesian Estimation of Differential Equations with Probabilistic Programming

For a good overview of how to use the tools of SciML in conjunction with the
Turing.jl probabilistic programming language, see the
[Bayesian Differential Equation Tutorial](https://turing.ml/dev/tutorials/10-bayesiandiffeq/)
or the [extended Bayesian differential equation notebook](https://github.com/TuringLang/TuringTutorials/blob/master/10_diffeq.ipynb).
